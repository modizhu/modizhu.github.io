This is the project of real time bus tracking.
Here we are tracking the bus between MIT and Harvard.

We can use other maps to get the locations somewhere else.

But here, we use the MBTA bus data to determine stops between MIT and Harvard.
When click the button, it will show the bus stops on the route by an animated marker on the map.
