This is PacMen Exercise Project.
In the project, we can create as many Pacman as we want, and then make them move across the screen.
When you click the "Add PacMan" button, a new pacman appears at a random position on the screen.
When you click the "Start Game" button, the pacman or pacmen created will start moving at random velocity on the screen.
When a given pacman hits the edge of the screen, it will change position to stay within the frame of the web page.
We can add some more images to enrich the project,and we can also add some more actions in the pacmen.js file to enchance the behavior of the pacmen.
