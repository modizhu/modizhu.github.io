    Hi!
    <p>

        <p>
            I am MODI ZHU, from Georgia Institute of Technology. I am a Ph.D. student in Civil and Environmental Engineering, and I am also a master student in computational science engineering. I am studying hard to learn coding, and I hope that I can find a job
            in 2023. And I also have a lot of hobbies, like playing basketball, cooking, and lifting. I hope that I can be friends with everybody! You can contact me at modizhu@gatech.edu.
